hat is] the condensed definition of action.Moreover, action is also of five kinds: the action that is perception (upalab
dhikarman), the action that is efficacy (kāritrakarman), the action that is determination (vyavasāyakarman), the action 
that is transformation (pariṇatikarman) and the action that is obtainment (prāptikarman).In this context, however, the a
