What is the karman to be experienced in this lifetime? It is that, the ripening of which ripens in this lifetime, namely,
that [karman] which comes from doing damage or benefit to someone who has arisen from the concentration of benevolence.
As [in the case of deeds which one performs in order to do harm or benefit to someone arisen] from the concentration of 
benevolence, and likewise to one arisen from the concentration without defilements, from the meditative attainment of ce
ssation, from the fruit of a stream enterer, [or] from the fruit of an Arhat, and to the monastic community headed by th
e Buddha. Or, whatever wholesome or wholesome [deeds] which one performs with a perception [accompanied by] a particular
ly strong motivation (āśaya). [All those lead to results to be experienced in this lifetime.]What is the karman that is 
to be experienced after rebirth? It is that, the ripening of which ripens in the very next lifetime. For example, the ka
rman that consists in the five actions [that bring] immediate [retribution]. Or, again, other [kinds of] wholesome and u
nwholesome [karman].What is the karman to be experienced in another lifetime? That, the ripening of which ripens in a li
fetime later than that [following lifetime].[Explanation by XUANZANG: "Moreover [as for] the division of karman, there a
re four kinds, namely: black karman with black ripening, white karman with white ripening, black and white karman with b
lack and white ripening. Not black [and] white karman without ripening which extinguishes all karmas.]
